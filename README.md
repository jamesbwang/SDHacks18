Do you ever run into unexpected traffic conditions on the way to events or meetings? Not anymore - rouzzz is a dynamic alarm clock that monitors traffic so that you can sleep as much as possible and still arrive on time.

### Getting Started: 

The app runs using React Native, and the easiest way to use the app is through [Expo](https://expo.io/). Download the app onn your mobile device, clone this repository (on your computer), then from the rouzzz folder, run: 
```
npm install -g expo-cli
npm start
```
in terminal/cmd. Connect to Expo using your phone, and you should be able to pull up the app from there.
